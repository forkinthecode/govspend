I’ve worked with Rosie Williams on budget data transparency since November 2013. Rosie has developed her open data project into the best government data transparency initiative I know. OpenAus has been continually updated and improved to make underlying data intelligible and to focus on key aspects for analysis. My interest has particularly been on the transparency of federal budget data. BudgetAus is the best ongoing facility for reviewing and analysing spending data, especially by programme. Rosie’s efforts have added significantly to the transparency of federal budget data. She has also
 become an important member of the non-government community who are trying to enable better and more informed use government data.
